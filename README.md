##### Generating Preview Screenshots:

Apple requires that you provide screenshots of your app at various sizes to match the corresponding Apple devices. This is a pain in the ass. Guide:

1. Take screenshots of the app in the iPhone 6S Simulator by going to `File -> Save Screen Shot`. These will be saved on your desktop. 
2. Use [AppStoreSketch](https://github.com/MengTo/AppStoreSketch) and Sketch to autogenerate screenshots for the various device sizes.
3. Export, and upload them to iTunes connect.

#### Generating Video:

1. Plug your iPhone into your device, and run your app.
2. Open QuickTime, select `File -> New Movie Recording`. 
3. Turn off the microphone.
4. You should see your iPhone device screen being mirrored in QuickTime, and be able to record the screen.
